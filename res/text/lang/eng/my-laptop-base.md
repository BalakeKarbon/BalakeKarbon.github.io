    Why rely on some company's manufacturing, repair team, and parts for your mobile work station? If a sensor for temperature fails the entire system is compromised and then a part must be ordered, if it is available, and then installed to continue work. Problems like this greatly annoyed me to the point where I decided to rid of them. My mobile workstation is comprised of off the shelf common components shoved into a metal lunchbox. Airport TSA may think its a bomb but this solution has greatly improved my productivity. A custom build of Arch Linux drives the beast reliably without the pain of bloatware. The refined OS acting much like a sharpened knife would too a cook. The freedom of choice allowing the hardware to be designed around software development. An M.2 SSD paired to a I9 9900K with 16GB of DDR4 RAM compile, store, and manipulate my code. Then if anything goes wrong its a repair I can likely preform in the hour meaning up time is not significantly compromised.
