    Most developers find themselves writing code behind a mobile system developed by some big name company. Each developer must now rely on the support system given by that company. If a battery goes out, a sensor fails, or physical components or casings bend and fracture, they have to hope that their company can provide parts and supports to keep their system running. This all adds cost and delay to work. But as an engineer I decided I would rather not deal with these side affects as I have the skill to replace all of those systems.
