    My personal office setup always draws eyes. Find me at my favorite coffee shop or outside at a park typing data into a screen sitting next to a lunchbox. My custom build of Arch Linux hosting its own WiFi signal allowing me to tunnel in directly. Also allowing others to question why their phone has an access point labeled 'lunchbox' in the middle of a park. In small breaks from concentration one can find me making friends with locals or introducing others into the amazing world of technology. My unique tool set and personality making me quite the local icon. But also allowing me to work anywhere reliably, efficiently, and comfortably.
