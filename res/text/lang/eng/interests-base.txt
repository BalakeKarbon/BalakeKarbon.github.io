My interests generally derive from my obsession with manufacturing, self reliance, and automation. This is expressed throughout my daily life. Just take a look at what I drive, my 'laptop', or my ______. I just about daily drive one of two 1960s trucks I own due to their low elemental count and simplicity. My self taught mechanical knowledge makes these two vehicles extremely economical in my life. My 'laptop' is made up of off the shelf components, a lunchbox, and a very customized Arch Linux OS. Makes a great conversation starter at coffee shops or Airport TSA.
