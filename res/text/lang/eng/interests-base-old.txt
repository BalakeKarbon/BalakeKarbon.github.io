An obsession with manufacturing, resilience, and automation, bring me deep into the workings of computers. While my sociality and interest in nature bring me back to my humanity. That interaction has been a huge influence in the modern world and directly affected me. As such, you can find me digging around estate sales pulling out vintage computers for revival, maintaining my 1960s trucks, or even designing my own computer architectures from the ground up.
