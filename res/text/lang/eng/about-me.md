    I am Blake, a robust and adaptable software
developer. I understand the fundamentals of
processor design, how web-apps are interpreted
in a browser, and the path between those
processes. This full picture knowledge allows
me to quickly learn new technologies and stay
ahead of the curve in this constantly
evolving field. I bring an excited and
positive attitude to any team and enjoy
working together to provide innovative
solutions that exceed client expectations.
