    I am Blake, a robust software developer
with a broad understanding of computer
science. Whether you need a full-stack
solution for managing company inventory, AI
and evolutionary algorithms applied to
trading, or a mobile app for your business,
I am here to aid you in achieving your goals.
I have been an effective member in teams, and
work well with others, but can also be the
sole member on a project. My core
understanding of computer architectures allows
me to write reliable, efficient, portable, and
modular code. I am familiar with the use of
many API's and technologies, and am adaptable
to applying new and uncommon tools.
