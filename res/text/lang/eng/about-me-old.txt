      Hello, I am Blake. I daily drive a 1963 
Dodge W200 Power Wagon and my work computer
is a lunchbox. I have a passion for simple 
manufacturing and independence of which 
manifests itself in many vintage collections
of technology. I am one for understanding 
concepts as deeply as economically possible
allowing me to produce secure software and
robust technology. My passions and interests
drive me to teach myself new technologies,
techniques, and practices. I pride myself with
my focus on modularity, reliability, simplicity
compatability, and repairability.
