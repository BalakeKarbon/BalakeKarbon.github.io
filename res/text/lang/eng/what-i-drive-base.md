    My daily drivers consist of a 1963 Dodge Power Wagon and a 1960 International B120 pickup truck. I used to have a 2007 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon as well but I opted to sell it after learning how much better these two other trucks fit into my lifestyle. A vehicle must provide transportation, which in my lifestyle, involves constant outdoor adventure. My destinations often involving very technical off road trails in many different kinds of weather conditions. All 3 of my vehicles worked great in these areas but these trucks are better suited. Stronger and more reliable components mean the trucks break less often, more independent systems mean if something does fail I can still get home, and much cheaper parts in a simple design mean much less time and money spent repairing anything. My deep understanding of how automobiles work allows this to be possible.
    
    I need something that can take me where I need to go.
    These are more economical.
    I have the skill to use such tools.
