I'm Blake! A full-stack++ software developer, hardware designer, and vintage computing enthusiast with a knack for solving complex problems. I have developed engaging and memorable ReactJS front ends, structural and secure RESTful API's, and created internal tools for data analytics. Conversely I have also have developed firmware for novel immersive cooling systems, worked on kernel drivers for hardware adaptation, and developed unique pipelines exploring the limits of code portability and integration. I'm comfortable behind many environments, languages, toolchains, and API's; I am equally excited to learn your teams preferred workflow and environment.
